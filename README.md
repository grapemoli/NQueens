# N-Queens
The NQueens problem: let a user define an integer n. Then, place n queens on an n-by-n board such that no queen sits in a position that directly attacks another queen.

## User Inputs
Users should input an integer that is higher than 3. The number inputted will be the size of the chessboard, and the number of queens on the chessboard. 

Thanks to the makefile, the user only needs to select the directory and type "make run" on the tesla command line. "make run" will compile and run the compiled output.

## User Outputs
The output is the positions of the queens, such that no one queen can directly attack one another.
